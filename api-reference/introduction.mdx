## Overview (TEST 4pm)

Teal is a payroll API platform, streamlining the entire income verification process by connecting you to data sourced from payroll and HR systems or analysing income documents, all with the user consent at the core.

Teal supports you during the underwriting process, increasing both speed and accuracy levels. With this information you can assess the level of affordability of a borrower, by verifying their level of income and their employment status.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```
Secure your API interactions through standard HTTP basic authentication:

- `username` — Your `api_key_id`
- `password` — Your `api_key_secret`

Example request:

```json
curl <https://api>.[yourdomain].com/v2/[endpoint] \\
  -u api_key_id:api_key_secret
```

## Environments

Our API offers two environments to cater to different stages of development and production:

- **Production:** For real-world use. Base URL: `https://api.[yourdomain].com/v2`
- **Sandbox:** For testing with simulated data. Base URL: `https://api-sandbox.[yourdomain].com/v2`


## Data

After connecting a new account, data is retrieved in stages:

- **Instant Data:** Quickly available post-connection, covering static information that changes infrequently.
- **Event Data:** Compiled over time, providing a historical view that can extend back several years.

We continuously update and enrich your data as new information becomes available.



### Security

To protect your API keys:

- Only make API calls from server-side applications.
- Avoid embedding API keys in client-side code.
- Store keys securely, outside of your application's source code repository.
- Regularly review and prune old or unused keys.

### Handling Responses

Our API uses standard HTTP status codes for feedback:

- `200 OK`: Request succeeded.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded, etc.
